The bad parts I didn't like so much compared to the Ruby programming language so I decided to implement some of Ruby's usefulness for Lisp by creating a code interpreter that not only found and replaced some functionality, such as rest parameters, but also injected pseudo object oriented paradigms for lists to act like Ruby array objects.") %>
      
      <%= render("_/card", head: "Bash Automation", body: "I attempted learning Ruby on Rails four separate times, failing the first three. I wasn't (and still amn't) a guru at the command line which was my biggest fear and pitfall for getting started. After making several apps using Rails in the Cloud9 environment, I made a couple bash scripts to completely automate the process from creating a new workspace in C9 to a live running app in Heroku and backed up on Github.") %>
      
      <%= render("_/card", head: "Upskill Courses", body: "The one tutorial that brought everything together for me for Ruby on Rails was Upskill Courses. There I learned integrating gems, styling, backend, everything to get me started on my own projects. Everything I was confused about after finishing Michael Hartl's blog tutorial, Upskill clarified with ease. I started on my own projects after I finished because I was ready to create web apps on my own.") %>

Most of the work here was done on paper, as planning is important to me as a measure for successful execution.
