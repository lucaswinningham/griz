      <%= render("_/card", head: "2015", body: "Before graduation, I signed on with a material handling company as a Project Engineer. Here I specialized in controls design and installation, overseeing and implementing each phase of my projects. I had the opportunity to travel to Central America for international projects, experiencing different cultures by being immmersed in them for weeks at a time. It was during installations like these that I discovered myself being drawn more and more toward programming.") %>
      
      <%= render("_/card", head: "2016", body: "Following my time as a Project Engineer, I accepted a position with an automotive manufacturer as a Controls Engineer. Here I was able to develop and implement ideas to allow for rapid prototyping and automated design of schematics and programs using multiple programming languages. Specifically, I standardized drawings for new machines and significantly reduced initial drawing design time using Lisp for AutoCAD.") %>

I have always been fascinated by the principles and concepts of design, and it is electrifying to be able to combine these with programming. I am certain I have found my vocation and I know I will excel as I continue to develop my skills and abilities as a web developer.") %>
